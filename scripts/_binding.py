_binding.py — ONE definition of "what repository is this checkout bound to".

WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE. Three places have to answer that question and none
of them may import the others: the payload builders
(`insights_flush_payload`, 3,600 lines), the judge Stop hook
(the review hook, which deliberately imports neither of the big modules so
a stop costs one process start), and `--insights-status`
(`_insights_session`, 6,000 lines, on the SessionStart fast path). The first
round of PX2 gave each of them its own reader, and they diverged inside one
change: the payload builders refused a binding whose origin had moved while the
judge hook kept sending its id, so the two lanes disagreed about which
repository the same commit belonged to.

A stdlib-only LEAF, like `_fm_ignore` and `_plugin_policy` beside it — importing
it costs nothing else, which is what makes it reachable from the Stop hook.

THE STALENESS RULE, stated once here because it is the part that diverged. A
binding names ONE origin, it is recorded on disk, and the origin can be
re-pointed afterwards (a fork promoted to upstream, an organisation renamed).
The catalog id is matched EXACTLY and ahead of everything else server-side, so
a stale one does not degrade into a near miss — it files this repository's work
under a different repository. So a binding applies only while the origin it was
made for is still this checkout's origin, and both sides of that comparison go
through the same normalizer: the stored url is the CATALOG's own spelling,
which is not ours to assume.
