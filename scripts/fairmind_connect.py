fairmind_connect.py — the engine behind `/fairmind-connect` (PX2).

WHAT IT IS FOR. Until this existed, the only instruction for connecting a
checkout to the platform was PROSE addressed to an agent — "point them to
Studio -> avatar -> Developer page for the project API key + the MCP snippet"
— and the repository identity every lane then sent was a FOLDER NAME. The
server resolves projects by ObjectId or exact name, so a folder called
`payments-api` under a project called "Payments Platform" fell through
silently, every row landed under a key that joins to nothing, and the
link from a decision to the function it concerns was never even
attempted. This command makes the connection a VERIFIED ACT and replaces the
folder name with the code-ingestion catalog id everywhere the plugin
speaks.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and the boundaries are the design:

  * It NEVER writes `~/.claude.json`. The MCP entry carries a bearer token;
    a tool that edits that file on a developer's behalf is a tool that can
    point their credential somewhere. It prints the exact command instead.
  * It resolves NOTHING itself. The repository is matched server-side, on the
    origin url, by the door that owns the catalog. The plugin stays dumb: it
    reports what it has and records what it is told (IP boundary, ONB-1).
  * It invents no wire field. Once bound, the catalog `_id` travels in the
    EXISTING `repository` field of the decisions and audit payloads — the
    server's matcher takes an id or a name on that same parameter — so an
    UNBOUND checkout's payloads stay byte-identical to what they were.

THE SILENT TRAPS IT EXISTS TO NAME (each measured, not assumed):

  1. Arming needs a PER-PROJECT entry whose key matches `^fairmind(?![a-z0-9])`
     (`_insights_session._FAIRMIND_NAME_RE`). A user-global entry is ignored BY
     DESIGN — counting it would make every repository on the machine a tenant —
     and a committed `.mcp.json` needs this project's explicit approval. A
     developer who pasted the snippet at the wrong scope sees a plugin that
     looks configured and captures nothing.
  2. The Developer page names the key after the browser's host — `Fairmind` on
     prod, `Fairmind-dev` on dev — and the plugin's anchored regex arms BOTH.
     A key copied from the wrong Studio therefore arms the wrong backend, in
     silence. This command cannot know which host is "right" (no host table
     ships in a customer-facing plugin, and the token carries no environment
     claim), so it reports what it CAN measure: two armed keys pointing at two
     different hosts, side by side, for a human to settle.
  3. The key expires and cannot be renewed. `exp` is printed on every run and
     an expiry inside 30 days is a warning, because the failure it prevents —
     a lane that silently stops delivering — has no other local symptom.
  4. `--project B` against a key whose own `projectId` claim is A. The server
     enforces per-project write access from the VERIFIED claim, never from
     what the caller named, so a bind under the override records B locally
     while every write this key attempts is checked against A and refused —
     the first symptom used to be a loop's write-back reporting "not synced".
  5. A key with no `write`/`admin` `scope` claim — every key minted before
     the claim existed, or copied with no project selected. Reads still work,
     so this is a warning rather than a trap: the connect is legitimate, only
     the write-back is dead on arrival.

EXIT CODES, which the command body branches on:

    0  bound (or already bound — a re-run is idempotent)
    1  a trap the developer must fix; every trap found is printed, not the first
    2  usage
    3  no project could be resolved: the token carries no `projectId` claim and
       no `--project` was given. The command body answers this one by asking.
    4  retryable: the BIND door answered 503, or the network did not answer at
       all. A tenant-status door that fails is only a warning — it is a
       diagnostic, and the bind below is the real test of whether anything
       works — so it never produces this code on its own.

Stdlib only, like every script in this plugin. Every server call is REST:
the bind door has an MCP twin, but the twin has no status codes — every
refusal arrives as a `message` string — while the traps above are exactly the
distinctions a status code makes.
