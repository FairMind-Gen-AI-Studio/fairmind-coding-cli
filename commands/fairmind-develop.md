# fairmind-develop

Implement a Fairmind **user story or task** with the whole team, human-driven. The Technical Lead pulls the work from Fairmind — every task under a story, plus the implementation roadmap in the project documents — and returns an ordered plan. You confirm it. Then this command drives the team task by task: implement → test → review.

## Usage

```bash
/fairmind-develop US-142        # a user story: every task under it, in roadmap order
/fairmind-develop TASK-871      # a single task
```

The argument is **required**: this command implements the work you name, not whatever `active-context.json` happens to point at.

## The twin, and the difference that matters

`/fairmind-loop` and `/fairmind-develop` share a bootstrap and differ in what ends them:

| | `/fairmind-loop` | `/fairmind-develop` |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | one task | a story (all its tasks) or one task |
| Driver | an **executed gate** re-runs the checks at every turn end | you, between tasks |
| "Done" means | the checks passed | **you approved** |
| Needs | machine-checkable acceptance criteria | a Fairmind workspace |

**There is no executed gate here.** Say so in the closing report: this mode produces a reviewed diff, not a passed stop condition. When a task's acceptance criteria *are* machine-checkable, offer to run that one task through `/fairmind-loop` instead — that is the stronger guarantee, and it is one task wide.

## Connected mode only

This command's whole input — story, tasks, tests, roadmap — comes from Fairmind, so it runs only when the platform is reachable. The test is **whether a Fairmind transport is usable** — the `fairmind` CLI first, the `mcp__Fairmind__*` tools otherwise, exactly as the `fairmind-cli` skill's Step 1 decides — not what `active-context.json` says: that file's `fairmind` field is a cached answer, and Phase 0 bootstraps it to `"none"` on a fresh repo before anyone has checked, so trusting the field would fail every first run. Make this the **first substantive step of Phase 0** (the banner the hook already printed is a fixed opener, so its appearing before a clean "not connected — stopping" message is not misleading). If neither transport is usable, stop and point the user at `/fairmind-loop` (which runs standalone) or at plain interactive work — do not improvise a story from the repo. When they are present, the Technical Lead stamps `fairmind: "configured"` as it queries (Phase 1), so the field ends the run agreeing with reality.

## Operational quickstart (gotchas)

- **The Technical Lead cannot dispatch the team — you can.** A sub-agent has no `Task` tool (the harness withholds it regardless of the agent's own frontmatter), so every dispatch in this command is made by **you**, the orchestrator, one level deep. The Technical Lead plans and returns; it never engages another agent. This is the same topology `/fairmind-loop` uses.

- **Repoint before any `.fairmind/` write.** `validate-fairmind-path.sh` scopes writes to `active-context.json`'s `base_path`, and a context left behind by a previous run points somewhere else. Worse, a stale `"mode": "loop"` whose loop is finished **stands the journal hook down and MISATTRIBUTES the trace capture** for this whole run (the liveness gate reads a dead loop as "not live"). ⚠️ **Corrected — this used to say the stale marker "mutes … the trace capture", and that has been false since JC8:** capture no longer goes dark on a dead loop, it DEGRADES, so the rows survive but land in `.fairmind/degraded/` stamped `interactive` instead of on this run's own ledger. Silence was the old behaviour and it cost 23 days of trace rows in the plugin's own repo, which is why it was replaced; the journal hook, which blocks rather than records, still stands down. `loop_open.py --repoint --mode develop` fixes both in one atomic write — it stamps `mode: "interactive"`. Run it as the run's first mutation. **What that stamp does to capture, now that the routing rule reads the disk and not only the marker:** this command repoints with `--base-path .fairmind`, which is the same folder the loop lane documents, so in a repo that has run a loop the finished loop's `loop-state.json` is still lying right there — and that file is the whole test. It says those ledgers are that loop's and this run is not it, so this run's capture rows go to `.fairmind/no-loop/`, never into the loop's own ledgers. They carry no `after_loop` stamp — that key names the loop a row follows, and the ref on this context is *this* run's, not that loop's, so claiming it would be a false attribution; the directory alone carries the fact. That is the fix for a real defect and not a nicety: before it, one sub-agent completion under exactly this marker appended to the finished loop's own `subagent-tokens.jsonl` and evicted **502** of its in-window rows (measured 2026-08-16, 2,001 → 1,500). (A loop that ended through the engine leaves `mode: "closed"` on its own — **not** a synonym for `interactive`, see `INTERNALS.md`'s **Interactive mode vs loop mode** section for the one table both values are decided by; the stale-`loop` case that remains is a crash, a `kill` or a hand close, and the repoint covers it either way.)

- **A story's tasks are paginated.** `Studio_list_tasks_by_session` returns 20 at a time. "All the tasks" means paging until `hasMore` is false — a first-page fetch silently drops the rest of the story.

## Phase 0 — Opening

The **banner** is printed for you by the plugin's `UserPromptExpansion` hook the moment `/fairmind-develop` is invoked — you do **not** print it. (A banner run from the command body as a Bash *tool* call is collapsed by the client to "Ran 1 shell command" and never shown; the hook emits it as a rendered `systemMessage` instead.) Your first action is the connected-mode check:

**Check connected mode** (see above): run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/fairmind_cli.py --probe --online` and follow the `fairmind-cli` skill. Exit `0` → **CLI transport**: every `mcp__Fairmind__<Tool>` call in this command is made with `fairmind_cli.py tools call <Tool> …` (results for `inbox/` with `--save`, the Phase-Exit writes with `--yes`), per that skill. Exit `2` → tell the user to run `fairmind auth login` themselves, then stop. Otherwise, if no Fairmind MCP tools are available to you either, stop here with a clear "not connected" message and the pointer to `/fairmind-loop`. Only continue when one transport is usable; use that one for every call below. ⚠️ **Test for the FAMILY, not for the literal `Fairmind`.** The server key is whatever the checkout configured and only has to match `^fairmind` case-insensitively (`_FAIRMIND_NAME_RE` in `scripts/_mcp_config.py`) — `Fairmind` on prod, `Fairmind-dev` on dev — so the tools may reach you as `mcp__fairmind-dev__Studio_get_task` and a check for the exact `mcp__Fairmind__` spelling would stop this command on a perfectly connected repository. Use whichever mount you actually have for every Fairmind call below; the `allowed-tools:` line above can only spell one, so a different mount asks you for permission rather than refusing.

Then repoint the context at the work starting now (`<ref>` is the command's argument):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/loop_open.py --repoint --mode develop --task-ref <ref> --base-path .fairmind
```

`.fairmind` is deliberately wide at this point: the real `base_path` is `.fairmind/<project-slug>/<session-slug>`, and those slugs are only known after Phase 1a queries Fairmind. Narrow it in Phase 2, once you know them.

Everything after this is silent preparation until the plan lands: no play-by-play of which file or tool you are reading.

## Phase 1 — Plan (you fetch, the Technical Lead plans)

🔴 **The fetching is yours, not the sub-agent's, and this is not a style choice.** A
sub-agent's `tools:` line is a literal roster that cannot follow the per-checkout mount name
described above, so an agent granted `mcp__Fairmind__Studio_get_task` is simply blind wherever
the key is spelled otherwise. You inherit the session's real mounts; the Technical Lead does
not, and since 2026-09-12 holds no Fairmind tool at all.

### Step 1a — resolve the context and stage the inbox

1. `mcp__Fairmind__General_list_projects` and `mcp__Fairmind__General_list_work_sessions` →
   the project and session, **name and id for each**. Slugify both the way the Technical
   Lead does (lowercase, non-alphanumerics to hyphens) so you can name the base path:
   `FAIRMIND_BASE=.fairmind/<project-slug>/<session-slug>`.
2. Retrieve what the run needs and **write it verbatim** under `${FAIRMIND_BASE}/inbox/`:

   | File | From |
   |---|---|
   | `task.json` (one per task) | `Studio_get_task` |
   | `user-story.json` | `Studio_get_user_story`, `Studio_get_related_user_stories` |
   | `requirements.json` | `Studio_list_functional_requirements_by_session` + `..._technical_...` |
   | `tests.json` | `Studio_list_tests_by_userstory`, falling back to `..._by_project` |
   | `documents/` | `General_rag_retrieve_documents_for_session`, then `General_rag_retrieve_documents`, then the story's attachments |

   Resolving a **user story** means the story *and every task under it*: there is no
   "tasks by user story" door, so filter `Studio_list_tasks_by_session` (or `..._by_project`)
   by `userStoryId` and **page until `hasMore` is false** — the page size is 20 and an unpaged
   call silently drops the rest of a large story.
3. Write `${FAIRMIND_BASE}/inbox/inbox.md`: what you fetched, **what came back empty, and
   what failed**. Those last two are different facts and lead to opposite actions — an empty
   set is something to proceed on, a failed call is not. Say which listings you paged.

### Step 1b — dispatch the planner

Dispatch **one** `Technical Lead / Architect` sub-agent. It bootstraps the workspace, pulls the work, finds the roadmap, writes the work packages, and **returns**. Its brief must be explicit that it plans and does not dispatch:

> This is an **interactive develop** run — never enter loop mode, never set `mode: "loop"`, and skip the loop contract/budget phase. Resolve `<ref>` and prepare the work, then STOP and report — do not engage any other agent (you have no `Task` tool; the orchestrator dispatches the team).
> 0. Your context is already on disk: read `${FAIRMIND_BASE}/inbox/`, starting with `inbox.md`. You hold no Fairmind tool and must not look for one; an input that is neither in the inbox nor in your brief is a gap to report, never one to fetch.
> 1. Phase 0 bootstrap: the project and session slugs are in your brief and in `inbox.md` — build the `.fairmind/<project>/<session>/` tree and `context.json` from them. **Merge** `.fairmind/active-context.json` — set `base_path` and the identity fields, and set `fairmind: "configured"` (you reached the platform), but keep the `mode: "interactive"` the command already wrote; do not overwrite it.
> 2. Resolve the ref against the inbox. A **task** → that task's `task.json`. A **user story** → the story and *every* task staged under it; if `inbox.md` does not say the listing was paged to exhaustion, say so rather than assuming the set is complete.
> 3. Find the implementation roadmap in `inbox/documents/` and persist it under `execution_plans/`. Derive the task order from it. No roadmap → `.no-roadmap` marker, order by dependencies then priority.
> 4. Turn `inbox/tests.json` into one markdown file per test under `requirements/tests/` (the QA Engineer's single source of truth), or the `.no-tests` marker when it is empty by design.
> 5. Write one work package per task and role, and the conductor summaries.
> Report back: the ordered task list with the reason for the order, the roadmap document you used (or that none exists), the work-package paths, and every gap or risk you found.

## Phase 2 — Confirm the plan (the one mandatory human touchpoint)

Narrow the scope to the real workspace now that the slugs exist:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/loop_open.py --repoint --mode develop --task-ref <ref> --base-path .fairmind/<project-slug>/<session-slug>
```

Then present, in this order, and **wait**:

1. **The ordered task list** — one line per task, with what it delivers.
2. **Where the order comes from** — the roadmap document by name, or "no roadmap found: ordered by dependencies, then priority". Two distinct questions, in order: first, *is this the right document?* — a retrieved doc is a candidate, so have the user confirm it is the roadmap they mean. Then, once confirmed, its order is the **default**: if it conflicts with a task's own steps, the roadmap wins — say so out loud. The user may still override the order explicitly; what you must never do is silently pick the roadmap over an order the user stated, or silently pick your own over the roadmap.
3. **The dispatch budget** — a **floor**, not a cap: `1 + tasks × 3` (one Technical Lead plan already spent, plus engineer + QA + review for each task; the closing report is your own message, not a dispatch). On top of that, budget for what the run may still need and cannot pre-count: **up to two repair dispatches** per failing task, and a **Security Engineer** for each task that warrants one. Present the floor and these add-ons together so the confirmed number is not one a single failing task blows through. The run **stops between tasks** for your go-ahead; offer the alternative (run through, report at the end) rather than assuming it.
4. **Gaps** — a task with no acceptance criteria, a story with no tests, a missing blueprint. These do not block, but they are the things that will make the review inconclusive.

The user confirms or adjusts the order, the budget, and the stop-between-tasks default before a single line of code is written.

## Phase 3 — Implement, task by task

For each task, in the confirmed order:

1. **`Software Engineer`** — brief it with its work-package path, `fairmind-tdd`, and the acceptance criteria. It writes its own journal; the `SubagentStop` hook refuses its completion otherwise.
2. **`QA Engineer`** — brief it with the test files under `${FAIRMIND_BASE}/requirements/tests/`. It reads them from disk; it does not re-query Fairmind.
3. **`Code Reviewer`** — the diff for this task against its acceptance criteria.
4. **`Security Engineer`** — **only when the task touches** authentication, authorization, secrets, cryptography, payments, personal data, or an externally-reachable input. Say why you did or did not engage it; do not run it by reflex.
5. **Fixes** — send failures back to the `Software Engineer` with a targeted fix package, at most **twice**. Still failing after the second round means the problem is not a coding slip: stop the task, summarise what fails and the two attempts, and hand it to the user. Do not keep re-dispatching.
6. **Stop** and report the task's outcome before starting the next one, unless the user chose run-through.

Track progress with `TodoWrite` so the user can see where the run is without asking.

## Exit

1. **Report** — per task: delivered / failed / handed back, the review verdict, the journals. Then the run totals against the budget. State plainly that this was a human-reviewed run, not a gated one.
2. **The final approval gate — this is what "done" means here.** There is no executed gate, so *your approval of the completed work* is the entire stop condition. Present the report and **wait for the user to approve it**, even in run-through mode — run-through skips the between-task check-ins, not this. Do not treat the plan approval in Phase 2, or a passing review, as this approval: those are about *what to do* and *whether a step succeeded*; this is the human signing off on the result. Nothing below happens until the user approves; if they reject, the rejected tasks go back to Phase 3, not forward.
3. **Write back to Fairmind — a second, separate ask.** Only after the approval above, and asked for on its own: advance the task status (`Studio_bulk_update_status`) and attach the journals (`Studio_process_journal`). This mutates the platform outside this repo — never automatic, never folded into the approval in step 2.
4. **Offer the stronger guarantee** — for any task whose acceptance criteria are machine-checkable, offer `/fairmind-loop <task-ref>`: the same work, driven by an executed gate instead of by a review.
