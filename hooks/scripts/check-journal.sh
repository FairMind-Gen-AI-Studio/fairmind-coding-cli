# check-journal.sh — SubagentStop hook: refuse to let a sub-agent finish when it
# changed code in a Fairmind workspace and wrote no journal.
#
# WHY SubagentStop, not Stop (PCF-1): the harness fires `Stop` ONLY for the main
# agent; a Task/Agent sub-agent finishing fires `SubagentStop`. This hook used to
# be wired to `Stop` and gate on `CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME` matching a role slug — but
# `Stop` never sees a sub-agent, and `CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME` is not a variable the
# harness sets (verified against the hooks + env-vars docs), so the check
# enforced for NOBODY. It now fires on `SubagentStop` and takes the sub-agent's
# identity from the JSON payload's `agent_type`, not an env var. `SubagentStop`
# blocks on exit 2 exactly like `Stop`.
#
# Scope: enforces for ANY sub-agent that mutated non-.fairmind code — not a fixed
# role allowlist. The old four-slug allowlist could never match the payload's
# plugin-scoped display name (`fairmind-coding:QA Engineer`) anyway, and for an
# audit-trail guarantee "any code-mutating sub-agent must journal" is the safe,
# resilient rule. Read-only sub-agents mutate nothing, so the code-change check
# exempts them; the main orchestrator never reaches this event at all; and a
# loop-mode session enforces only while its loop is LIVE (PCF-11, below).
#
# Exit-code contract: a SubagentStop hook blocks on exit 2 and ONLY on exit 2;
# any other non-zero exit is reported and the sub-agent finishes anyway. So
# `set -e` is actively dangerous here — an abort (missing jq → 127, unparseable
# context → 5, `find` on a journals/ directory that does not exist yet → 1) lets
# the sub-agent finish clean in exactly the state this hook exists to block. So:
# no `set -e`; a missing dependency or an unreadable active-context.json is a
# refusal (exit 2), and a missing journals/ directory is simply "no journal was
# written" and must flow into the normal check rather than abort it.
#
# Outside a Fairmind workspace (no active-context.json) the hook stays a silent
# no-op — the plugin can be installed in a repo that never opens a session, and
# that no-op must hold even with no dependencies on PATH.

# PCF-11: a loop-mode session enforces only while its loop is LIVE. A stale
# active-context left pointing at a CLOSED/merged loop — its loop-state.json gone
# or in a terminal state — must not arm the journal check on every unrelated
# sub-agent. That is the exact false-fire PCF-1's now-working enforcement first
# produced (a fork writing a doc, blocked against a dead loop's workspace). This
# mirrors loop-check.sh, which already no-ops on "no loop-state, or a terminal
# state". Interactive sessions carry no liveness marker, so they are unchanged:
# active-context existence remains their signal.

# `closed` is the THIRD mode value: a loop ran here and FINISHED. run_gate_checks
# writes it at the terminal status, which is what nothing did before — the marker
# used to keep claiming `mode: loop` over a dead loop for ever. The stand-down is
# mandatory rather than nice-to-have: `closed` would otherwise fall through to the
# rule below and journal-gate every code-mutating sub-agent against the DEAD
# loop's journals/, blocking it on exit 2. That is the exact PCF-11 false fire
# (see the note below), resurrected by a value PCF-11 could not have known about.
#
# So JOURNAL BEHAVIOUR IS UNCHANGED BY THE NEW VALUE: it stood down before, over
# a stale `mode: loop` marker whose loop-state was terminal, and it stands down
# after, over the `closed` marker that now replaces it. What changed is only
