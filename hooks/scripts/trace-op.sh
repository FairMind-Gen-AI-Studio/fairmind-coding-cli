# trace-op.sh — PostToolUse hook: append an append-only operations trace of the
# mechanical *what* of a Fairmind session (which tool touched what), so the run
# is reconstructable. Journals stay the narrative *why*; this is the ledger.
#
# Composition rule (same as the other hooks): fast path first — a repo with no
# active Fairmind workspace pays nothing and no trace is written. The hook never
# blocks a tool: every failure path exits 0.
#
# PL-A0 (PCF-16) + JC8: every session inside a Fairmind workspace traces. A
# stale active-context left pointing at a CLOSED/terminal loop must not keep
# appending to that loop's ledger — so it DEGRADES to interactive and its rows
# go to their own ledger (_loop_ledger.DEGRADED_REF), rather than going dark as
# they did before JC8. The rule the resolver applies is wider than the stale
# case and is stated there in one line: a capture hook may write into a LOOP's
# own ledgers only when this session IS that live loop — which is TWO claims,
# WHICH loop and WHOSE session, so a live loop-state at base_path settles
# neither on its own. For the routed cases read resolve_loop_context; the plugin
# INTERNALS.md (Capture routing) holds the documented table. This
# header carries the rule, not the list. The liveness gate and the locked append+window-safe rotation
# both live in scripts/_loop_ledger.py (resolve_loop_context / append_row, shared
# with capture-subagent-tokens.sh, so the two can never drift). Every row carries
# session_id (from stdin) + mode, and the active ledger is always capped (~2000
# rows): rows older than the loop started_at may roll while a row whose ts >=
# started_at NEVER does (those are read whole mid-loop by run_gate_checks
# settle/mutation-set, insights_flush_payload, loop_dashboard); before the loop
# arms it falls back to a newest-N cap so it stays bounded.
