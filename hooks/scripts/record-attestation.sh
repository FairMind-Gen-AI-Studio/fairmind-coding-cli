# SubagentStop: record that a sub-agent of a given identity finished, while THIS
# session is driving a live loop.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `--record-completeness --by <role>` is otherwise a claim the
# caller types about itself, and the caller -- the orchestrator -- is the party
# that wants the loop to close. maker != checker enforced on a self-reported
# string enforces nothing; this repo has already shipped that defect one layer
# over (a checker hand-editing loop-state.json to overturn admission).
#
# `agent_type` on the SubagentStop payload is the one identity the model does
# not author: the harness sets it, the same field check-journal.sh reads after
# PCF-1 proved CLAUDE_AGENT_NAME is set by nobody.
#
# IDENTITY IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE, and gating on `mode`+`status` alone was not
# enough (PR #105 review, round 3). `active-context.json` and `loop-state.json`
# are REPO-GLOBAL, so every session in the checkout resolves the same context: a
# second, unrelated session with a sub-agent finishing while a loop is armed
# would otherwise mint a spendable attestation for a tree it never reviewed --
# by accident, in an ordinary multi-session workflow. `_loop_ledger.
# resolve_loop_context` is the shared authority every sibling capture hook on
# this event already uses, and its own rule covers this file too: A CAPTURE HOOK
# MAY WRITE INTO A LOOP OWN LEDGERS ONLY WHEN THIS SESSION IS THAT LIVE LOOP.
# `ledger_dir is None` is that answer; anything routed writes NOTHING here,
# rather than writing elsewhere -- a diverted token row is still data, a
# diverted attestation would be evidence about a loop nobody reviewed.
#
# One place this is deliberately STRICTER than the resolver: an absent
# `session_id` makes ownership undecidable and the shared resolver fails OPEN
# (its other callers must never be diverted by a test they cannot answer). An
# attestation is evidence, so it fails CLOSED instead -- the cost is one more
# reviewer dispatch, and nothing is lost.
#
# IT RAISES THE COST; IT IS NOT UNFORGEABLE. The file lands under .fairmind/,
# which the owning session can write. What it buys is an audit artifact and a
# step that has to be deliberately faked rather than merely skipped. Do not
# describe it as more than that.
#
# NEVER BLOCKS. A missing dependency, an unreadable payload or a full disk must
# not stop a sub-agent from finishing: this hook records evidence, it does not
# gate anything. Every failure path exits 0. (check-journal.sh, on the same
# event, deliberately does the opposite -- it enforces a rule, so it fails
# closed. Two hooks, two jobs.)
