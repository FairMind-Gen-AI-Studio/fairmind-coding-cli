# inject-context.sh — hand a dispatched sub-agent the active Fairmind context
# (FAIRMIND_BASE, project_id, session_mindstreamId, plus any human steering
# from ${base_path}/steering.md — see fairmind-gate/references/steering.md).
#
# Registered twice, one job per event:
#
#   SubagentStart (`deliver`, the default) — DELIVERS. Emits
#     hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext, which Claude Code adds to the new
#     sub-agent's own context. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.280: a random token
#     emitted this way was quoted back verbatim by the dispatched sub-agent.
#     Plain stdout would not do: on most events, PreToolUse and SubagentStart
#     included, it goes to the debug log and reaches no model.
#
#   PreToolUse on Task (`check`) — REFUSES, and does nothing else. SubagentStart
#     cannot block, so the refusal lives here: inside an active workspace, a
#     missing jq or an unparseable active-context.json means the context cannot
#     be delivered, and a sub-agent that was never told where FAIRMIND_BASE is
#     writes outside the scoped path. This mode never writes to stdout and never
#     touches the tool input or the permission decision: it narrows what may
#     run, it grants nothing.
#
# Exit-code contract: PreToolUse blocks on exit 2 and ONLY on exit 2, so this
# script does not use `set -e` (a 127 or a jq 5 would abort with a non-blocking
# code). In deliver mode a failure is reported (exit 1) but cannot stop the
# sub-agent; the check that ran before the dispatch is what does.
#
# The two modes read active-context.json separately, so a passed check does not
# guarantee delivery: a file that changes or disappears between the dispatch and
# the start, or a delivery that times out, starts the sub-agent without the
# context. A sub-agent started by anything other than a PreToolUse-visible
# dispatch gets the delivery and no check.
