# loop-check.sh — Stop hook: the executed gate of fairmind-coding loop mode.
#
# Composition contract (design §6): this hook and check-journal.sh both fire on
# every Stop. Stop hooks compose with AND — a stop is blocked if EITHER hook
# exits 2. This hook is a silent no-op outside loop mode (no loop-state.json or
# status != running), so it never interferes with the interactive workflow.
#
# The "is there an active loop?" decision, the check evaluation, the budget
# accounting and the confirmation-gated stop all live in run_gate_checks.py
# (single source of truth). This wrapper only maps the engine's exit code to
# the Stop-hook contract:
#   engine 0  -> allow stop  (no loop, or terminal state) -> exit 0
#   engine 10 -> iterate     (feed feedback back, block)  -> exit 2
#   engine *  -> gate error  (surface, block once)        -> exit 2
#
# Exit 2 is the ONLY blocking code: any other non-zero exit is reported and the
# turn ends anyway. That cuts both ways, so this wrapper has two duties the engine
# cannot discharge for it:
#   - it must not need the engine to answer "is this even a Fairmind repo?".
#     Reaching run_gate_checks.py costs a python3 that a plain repo need not have,
#     and a failure to reach it maps to `gate error` -> exit 2, which would block
#     every stop in a repo that has no loop at all.
#   - once a workspace IS active it must never abort into a non-2 code. An unset
#     CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT under `set -u` is exactly that shape of bug, so the
#     variable is defaulted and checked explicitly, and the gate refuses out loud.
