# validate-fairmind-path.sh — PreToolUse on Write|Edit: keep writes to the
# .fairmind/ workspace inside the scope active-context.json ITSELF declares via
# its `base_path` field, derived per-session rather than hard-coded.
#
# PCF-12/PCF-14: this used to be a fixed two-level regex
# (`.fairmind/<slug>/<slug>/...`), which admitted ANY two-segment shape
# regardless of what a given session's active-context.json actually declared
# as its base_path (depth-not-scope: a sibling session at the same depth was
# wrongly admitted) and never inspected path segment content at all (a lexical
# `..` traversal segment sailed through — the regex only counted slashes). The
# scope is now DERIVED from the declared base_path, first-match decision
# ladder: (1) any '..' path segment refuses outright; (1.5) a target inside an
# EXISTING opt-in loop worktree parked at .fairmind/worktrees/<ref>/ is rebased onto
# that worktree's OWN root before anything else runs, since CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
# stays pinned to the main checkout for the life of the session — see the
# rung's own comment; (2) the bootstrap write to root-level
# active-context.json is always exempt; (3) if a base_path is declared, the
# target must lie under it; (4) a present-but-unreadable context refuses
# (fail-closed — it can never prove admission); (5) an absent context, or
# valid JSON with no base_path declared, falls back to the legacy
# two-level-scoped-path shape, byte-identical to the pre-PCF-12 behavior.
#
# Exit-code contract: PreToolUse blocks on exit 2 and ONLY on exit 2. Any other
# non-zero exit is reported and the Write/Edit proceeds. So an aborting script —
# `set -e` plus a missing jq (127) or a malformed payload (jq exits 5) — does not
# fail safe: it silently disables the guard at the one moment it cannot tell you
# it is disabled. Hence no `set -e`, and every failure inside an active workspace
# is a refusal (exit 2), never a shrug.
#
# Outside a Fairmind workspace (no active-context.json) the hook stays a silent
# no-op: the plugin may be installed in a repo that never opens a session, and a
# hook dependency it does not use must not block ordinary edits there.

# Rung 1.5 — worktree rebasing.
#
# A loop's opt-in maker worktree (`loop_worktree.py`, T9) lives at
# "$CWD/.fairmind/worktrees/<ref>/" — a full, separate git checkout that is
# merely PARKED inside the main checkout's own .fairmind/ directory (already
# excluded from the loop's own mutation set, hence parking it there at all).
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is fixed for the life of a session and keeps naming the
# MAIN checkout even when the session's actual cwd is that nested worktree, so
# an ORDINARY, in-worktree repository file (e.g. plugins/.../foo.py, wholly
# unrelated to any Fairmind workspace state) arrives here as
# ".fairmind/worktrees/<ref>/plugins/.../foo.py" — it carries the literal
# ".fairmind/" substring purely because of WHERE the worktree happens to be
# checked out on disk, never because the file is itself workspace state. Left
# unhandled, rung 3/4 below would measure that worktree-relative tail against
# the MAIN checkout's base_path — an unrelated workspace, declared for an
# unrelated task — and refuse every write for the life of the loop.
#
# Detect the nesting and rebase onto the worktree's OWN root before any scope
# comparison runs: everything past this rung continues to operate on
# CWD/CONTEXT_FILE/FILE_PATH exactly as before, just re-rooted. A target under
# the worktree that is NOT itself under the worktree's own .fairmind/ is
# ordinary and exits 0 immediately here, mirroring the non-.fairmind
# pass-through above; a target that IS under the worktree's own .fairmind/
# (its own active-context.json, its own journals, ...) falls through to rungs
# 2-5 unchanged, but reading THAT workspace's own declared scope, never the
# main checkout's. The '..'-segment refusal above already ran on the
# untouched path, so a worktree "ref" segment can never itself be a traversal
# component by the time this rung reads it.
#
# Only a worktree that EXISTS is rebased onto: its root must carry the `.git`
# file `git worktree add` writes. Any other name under .fairmind/worktrees/ —
# never created, or a plain directory — is ordinary main-checkout .fairmind/
# state and falls through to rungs 2-5 against the MAIN checkout's scope, so
# the path text alone can never widen what this hook admits
# (test_validate_path_scope.sh cases 24-27).
